# Voice ICR Practice

A TypeScript-powered Instant Character Recognition (ICR) practice application with voice-to-text capabilities, designed for Morse code and character recognition training.

## Features

- üé§ **Voice Recognition**: Uses Web Speech API for hands-free input
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Text Input**: Traditional keyboard input option
- üìä **Real-time Scoring**: Tracks accuracy and performance
- üéØ **Multiple Character Sets**: Alphabet, numbers, Morse code, prosigns, and custom sets
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- üöÄ **GitHub Pages Ready**: Easy deployment to GitHub Pages

## Browser Support

This application requires a modern browser with Web Speech API support:
- ‚úÖ Chrome/Chromium (recommended)
- ‚úÖ Microsoft Edge
- ‚úÖ Safari (macOS/iOS)
- ‚ùå Firefox (limited speech recognition support)

## Usage Instructions

### Getting Started
1. Enter your name or call sign (optional)
2. Select a character set or create a custom one
3. Click "Start Voice Input" or use Ctrl+Space to activate voice recognition
4. Look at the displayed character and speak or type your answer

### Character Sets
- **Alphabet**: A-Z letters
- **Numbers**: 0-9 digits  
- **Alphanumeric**: A-Z and 0-9 combined
- **Morse Code**: Standard Morse code characters
- **Prosigns**: Special procedural signals (=, +, >)
- **Custom**: Define your own character set

### Voice Recognition Tips
- Speak clearly and at normal volume
- For prosigns, say:
  - "BT" or "Break" for =
  - "AR" or "Roger" for +
  - "SK" or "End" for >
- The app will show what it heard for verification

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Ctrl+Space**: Toggle voice recognition
- **Enter**: Submit text input

## Customization

### Adding New Character Sets
Edit the `characterSets` object in `src/main.ts`:

```typescript
private characterSets = {
  // ... existing sets
  myCustomSet: ['X', 'Y', 'Z'].split(''),
};
```

### Modifying Voice Recognition
Adjust speech recognition settings in the `initializeSpeechRecognition()` method:

```typescript
this.recognition.lang = 'en-US';        // Language
this.recognition.maxAlternatives = 3;   // Number of alternatives
```

### Styling Changes
Modify `src/style.css` to customize the appearance. The design uses:
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Responsive design with media queries

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build TypeScript to JavaScript
npm run build

# Watch for changes during development
npm run dev

# Serve built files locally
npm run serve
```

## Troubleshooting

### Voice Recognition Not Working
- Ensure you're using a supported browser (Chrome recommended)
- Check browser permissions for microphone access
- Verify you're on HTTPS (required for microphone access)
- GitHub Pages automatically provides HTTPS

### Build Errors
- Ensure TypeScript is installed: `npm install`
- Check that all source files are in the `src/` directory
- Verify `tsconfig.json` configuration

### Deployment Issues
- Check GitHub Actions tab for build logs
- Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Verify the `deploy.yml` workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`
